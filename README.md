# Texturable Mod
Sick of getting stuck with the same textures on every vanilla part? Well, this mod can help!

This is a mod for Spaceflight Simulator with a simple goal, make more parts textureable.

Supported parts:

- Parachutes (not side ones)
- Heat Shields
- Docking Ports
- Landing Legs
- Structural Parts
- Solar Panels
- Probes (the top and bottom edges)

Do note, quite a few of these parts have colors laid on top of their textures that will change their tint, and some textures might be underwhelming and/or look weird because of it. I may be able to fix this in the future, but for now just keep that in mind and have fun!

# Known Issues
- `R Stripes` texture is broken and will not save to the parts. I have no idea why. I have tried everything in vain to fix it. All other vanilla textures, including all hidden ones, have been tested and work. Until further notice this bug will remain.

# How to Use
- Download `Texturable.dll` from the latest official release.
- Click the "Open Mods Folder" button in-game.
- Drag and drop the DLL, then restart the game.
